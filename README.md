# CV
My web + print HTML Curriculum Vitae.

## Project objectives

My main goal is to have an easy to update CV always on hand.

Because I'm a web developer at heart, I felt dirty trying CV layouts in Word. Having a web layout lets me toy around with the design freely and opens the door for future interactivity if I feel the need to expand from the confines of paper. When you think about it, it's an application of progressive enhancement to paper CVs.

The code should maintain a KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) approach for as long as possible, to avoid the necessity of a build step and leverage Github pages for hosting. As it is a simple layout, there's no real need for complicated frameworks anyway.

## To do

- Basic printable layout
- Add responsiveness
- Add links / other interactivity?

## "License"

Feel free to fork this project as a basis for your own CV if creativity is not a requirement for your intended position :)
