            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a software engineer with a passion for all things digital. When my father handed me down his old computer (my first), I immediately knew what I wanted to do for a living.
                Since that moment, I've been pursuing my love for technology in many different ways. I wrote a multiplayer text-based RPG in the golden age of mIRC, a sleeping/feeding time diary
                for new moms wearing Pebble smartwatches, I released the first version of the Portuguese card game Sueca in Google Play Store, among others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nowadays, I'm exploring the intersection between the web and the local computer, developing Progressive Web Apps, Electron apps, and everything in between.
                I firmly believe these technologies are a paradigm shift in how we view our devices and will in time help us achieve true harmony in both the application and operating system ecosystems.

                            which effects to apply to the guitar. I decided to reimagine that application for the web (leveraging the Web MIDI API for communication)
                            and thus allow me to use it easily on Linux.<br>
                            This project is also a means to explore Vue.js and keep in touch with alternative technologies that I don't use at work.

                            Inspired by the multiple Game Boy Zero projects of the maker community, I decided to make my own. A Game Boy Zero is a homemade handheld gaming console
                            that looks exactly like an old Game Boy but is capable of emulating many retro gaming systems by using a Raspberry Pi Zero (hence the name).
                            My version of the console currently uses a Raspberry Pi 3, which is harder to fit inside the Game Boy shell but provides better performance.
