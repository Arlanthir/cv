            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a software engineer with a passion for all things digital. When my father handed me down his old computer (my first), I immediately knew what I wanted to do for a living.
                Since that moment, I've been pursuing my love for technology in many different ways. I wrote a multiplayer text-based RPG in the golden age of mIRC, a sleeping/feeding time diary
                for new moms wearing Pebble smartwatches, I released the first version of the Portuguese card game Sueca in Google Play Store, among others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nowadays, I'm playing my part in the adoption of what I believe is the technology of the future: Progressive Web Apps. Soon, install wizards will be a thing of the past as the <em>web</em> jumps
                out of <em>website</em> and into the operating system. Now is the time to leverage this collision of worlds and achieve true harmony in the application ecosystem.

                        Development of a complex Progressive Web App for railway transportation workers. Supervisors, drivers and conductors
                        can use the app to view their work schedule, register work hours and send work-related requests to planners. The application
                        features internationalization (i18n) support so it can be used by SISCOG's multiple clients, such as the railway operators of
                        the Netherlands, Denmark and Canada.

                        I was personally responsible for researching the available frameworks and developing the initial prototypes, before implementing

                        Development of numerous web and hybrid mobile applications for different clients, along with their public-facing websites.
                        Applications ranged from social network contests using Facebook's APIs, to mobile games for children, food recipes portals, e-commerce
                        stores and tourism guides. I was also responsible for maintaining and adding features to the in-house Facebook campaign manager, as well
                        as implementing Outlook-compliant HTML newsletters.

                        Front-end development was mostly done in plain JavaScript using jQuery. The design team would provide Photoshop .psd files from which I would extract
                        the design elements that were not feasible to implement in CSS. Back-end technologies were PHP-based, the most common being Wordpress. Magento was used
                        in <span class="nowrap">e-commerce</span> stores.

                            Inspired by the multiple Game Boy Zero projects of the maker community, I decided to make my own. A Game Boy Zero is a homemade handheld gaming console
                            that looks exactly like an old Game Boy but is capable of emulating many retro gaming systems by using a Raspberry Pi Zero (hence the name).
                            My version of the console currently uses a Raspberry Pi 3, which is harder to fit inside the Game Boy shell but provides better performance.
